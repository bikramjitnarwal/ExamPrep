/* Consider the graph shown below. 
 
            2*
           /   *3*
         0     / |
          \   /  |
            1    4

(The * shows the direction of the connection) 

Give a depth-first traversal of the graph, starting at node 0. Assume that visiting a
node means printing its number to the standard output. 
  
Depth First Search (Use a stack) : 0 1 3 2 4 
Breadth First Search (Use a queue) : 0 2 1 3 4
